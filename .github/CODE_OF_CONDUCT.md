# Code of Conduct: An Ode to Harmony

## Prelude

Like music itself—which flows without asking where you're from, what you believe, or who you are—this project welcomes all who come with honest intent and respect for the craft.

In the spirit of a well-tuned ensemble, we seek harmony through our shared love of audio fidelity and the bits that carry it.

## Our Score

### The Melody of Respect

Music teaches us that every note matters, yet no single note makes the symphony. Here, we compose together:

- **Listen before you speak**, as one listens to a recording before judging its quality
- **Debate the code, not the coder**—critique the waveform, not the artist
- **Share knowledge freely**, like sharing a rare pressing with a fellow enthusiast
- **Acknowledge mistakes gracefully**, for even the finest recordings have imperfections
- **Remember**: We're all here for the music, the code, and the pursuit of perfect playback

### The Discord We Avoid

Some behaviors break the harmony, like digital noise in an analog dream:

- Personal attacks or harassment (take it offline, or better yet, take a walk)
- Publishing private information without consent
- Trolling, insults, or bad-faith arguments
- Anything you wouldn't do in a record shop among fellow collectors

## The Conductor's Role

Project maintainers will keep our sessions productive. If someone's playing out of tune repeatedly, they may be asked to leave the studio.

Reports of genuinely disruptive behavior can be sent to: guillain@poulpe.us

## Encore

In the end, we're all just trying to detect flaws in FLAC files and maybe learn something along the way. Be excellent to each other, respect the craft, and let the music (and the code) speak for itself.
