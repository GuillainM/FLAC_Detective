# Code of Conduct

## Our Mission

FLAC Detective is dedicated to maintaining authentic lossless audio collections. Our community values technical rigor, objective analysis, and the pursuit of audio quality.

## Community Principles

### Technical Excellence
- **Data-driven discussions**: Base arguments on measurements, spectral analysis, and reproducible tests
- **Objectivity first**: Focus on technical facts over subjective preferences
- **Share knowledge**: Help others understand audio formats, compression artifacts, and detection methods
- **Cite sources**: Reference technical documentation, research papers, or test results when making claims

### Constructive Collaboration
- **Respectful debate**: Challenge ideas with evidence, not personal attacks
- **Assume good faith**: Contributors may have different levels of technical expertise
- **Teach, don't mock**: If someone misunderstands MP3 encoding or FLAC compression, explain patiently
- **Code quality matters**: Review code for correctness, performance, and maintainability

### Community Standards
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused on audio analysis, FLAC files, and transcode detection
- **No gatekeeping**: Everyone starts somewhere - welcome newcomers learning about lossless audio
- **Professional conduct**: Disagreements should remain technical and civil
- **Respect privacy**: Don't share others' music collections or private information without permission

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal insults or ad hominem attacks
- Deliberate spreading of misinformation about audio formats
- Spamming, trolling, or derailing technical discussions
- Publishing private information without consent
- Any behavior that disrupts productive technical collaboration

## Scope
